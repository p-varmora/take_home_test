We need to verify that when the users of our API want jokes of a specific type they get it!  We are just about to start advertising our "Programming" jokesâ€¦

# Please create a standalone executable (code) in the language of your choice that executes the following three tests:

# Using https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/jokes/programming/random
1. Validate that the returned Joke is of type "programming"

# Using https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/jokes/programming/ten
1. Validate that 10 jokes are returned
2. Validate that all jokes are of type "programming"
